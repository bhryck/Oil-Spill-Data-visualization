The sheening site is adjacent to a FUDS site in which the Army Corp of Engineers removed 2000 old drums containing only 100+ gallons of mixed petroleum fluids.  In addition to old military drums, the dump site has been used by locals for years and contains derelict fishing gear, batteries, old vehicles, some medical waste and on and on.  As a result, this response is being funded by CERCLA.  NOAA has asked the NWS to provide a weeks' worth of Spot forecasts beginning November 23 and is currently providing tidal data for the incident.   The Coast Guard assessed the situation, Nov. 28, when a six-man team consisting of Coast Guard, state of Alaska, and contractor reps flew to Port Heiden.     Their first impression was how much had changed at the dump site from the photos taken only one month previous.  No sheens or evidence of on-going releases was observed.   Numerous old fuel drums were in the intertidal zone, all seriously rusted and open to the environment.  In one and one-half months time, the shoreline embankment had eroded back from 10 to 40 feet.

The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.  \u000b\tAt approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.  The lift boat was damaged, but the fuel tanks were reported to be intact.  Given the updated situation and the low probability of shoreline impacts from any minor release, the NOAA team is standing-down, but remains on stand by.

On-scene conditions were 55-knot winds, 30-foot seas, snow, icing conditions, and 1\/4 nm visibility.  The quantity of logs was quite large-200 to 400 log bundles of 80 to 100 logs per bundle.  The logs were 41 to 45 feet long and 4 to 15 inches in diameter; each bundle weighed approximate 27 tons.  The USCG deemed these logs a hazard to navigation of TAPS tankers, container vessels, and maritime traffic in the GOA.  Initially the logs were in MSO Juneau's zone and, along with the Seventeenth District Coast Guard Operations Center in Juneau, requested that NOAA provide weather forecasts and predict trajectories of the logs to monitor the position of the logs help their C-130 overflights.  NOAA's initial report to the USCG was that the trajectory of the logs will continue west-southwest at 2% of the wind speed (0.5 knots) until they cross the 100-fathom curve where they will encounter the Alaska Current and begin moving in a west-northwest direction at approximately the same speed.\u000bDue to the severe weather, many of the log bundles broke apart making it very difficult for ships' radar to see this debris.

In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water\/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.

Heavy surf and high winds throughout the next several days made boarding the vessel difficult and dangerous. While the preferred option was to salvage the vessel with the oil on board, the Unified Command requested that contingency plans for vessel lightering, cleanup and pollution response be developed.

PHONE (206) 526-6317. - _ - Per your request we have looked at trajectory implications of the urea that has been released from the barge Alaska.  These notes are based on the following information:-  - A barge located at 56? 28'N, 132? 23'W (Wrangell, Alaska) is reported to have cracks in the starboard and portside.  The vessel is carrying an unknown amount of urea stored as a bulk product.  At this time, the vessel is not leaking product.-  - If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. - _ - 1) WEATHER - Today, the winds are forecast from the south at 30 knots with rain.  Tomorrow, the rain is expected to continue with winds from the south at 25 knots. -  - 2) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UREA - Urea is a white crystal or powder with very faint odor. It has a density of 1.3 (it would sink in water) and is soluble in water. Urea is commonly present in nature, in urine and other body fluid. As a fertilizer, urea contains 45-46% nitrogen, and is usually in the form of small pellets or granules. It is shipped in bags or in bulk.  -  - 3) TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS - The harbor is generally shallow and is rapidly flushed due to tidal action.  Any dissolved product will be quickly diluted by water exchange through the harbor entrance.  The dissolved urea will not affect the pH of the water much, the effect, if there is any, will be localized, and given the tidal current present any effect will quickly dissipated because of the flushing effect in the harbor. -  - 4)FATE AND EFFECT OF UREA - Solubility - Urea is very soluble in water.  In the case of a capsized vessel, the urea pellets will sink to the ocean floor while  dissolving in the water column. Water currents facilitate the dissolution process of urea in the same way that stirring a cup of coffee helps dissolve the sugar faster. Since the urea was stored in bulk, the granules may disperse as a \"cloud\" of fertilizer, each granule sinking independently while coming in full contact with the water. - Effect on pH - When urea dissolves in water it forms a weak base. The pH of the ocean water varies between 6.5 to 8.5. Usually it tends to be somewhat basic. In addition, the ocean has a substantial buffering capacity. In the past even large urea spills had minimal effect on the pH and we would expect the similar process during this incident. - Effect on the environment - We would not expect to see any algae bloom or other nutrient driven changes. The spilled urea dissolves quickly, eventually turning into carbon dioxide which escapes as gas and dissipates, and ammonia, which dilutes in the prevailing tidal current and quickly drops to ambient concentration. It is quite possible that the concentration of available nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) may be elevated for a short period of time at the immediate location of the spill. However, considering the rapid dilution and dispersion into the water column, exposure to organisms is predicted to be short-term. The biological literature focuses on phytoplankton effects and these seem to be mediated by light.  At this time of the year, the phytoplankton population is relatively small, and the amount of daylight minimal.  Adverse effects are expected to be minimal and confined to the harbor.

Personnel from the Point Reyes National Seashore and the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary began collecting oiled live birds and dead birds.  The Coast Guard conducted an overflight, but did not find any floating oil.  By Monday, there were over 50 birds found dead, and an estimated 200 birds observed oiled in an area extending out to the Farallone Islands and south to Ocean Beach.

The spill site is actually two water bodies; an industrial barge canal in Bienville Industrial Park and a freshwater riverine\/marsh habitat in the adjacent Mulatto Bayou.  Mulatto Bayou runs somewhat parallel to the barge canal with several bank cuts allowing water interchange between the two.\u000b\u000bHopper barges RL-224 and RL-229 had been alongside the industrial park at the dead end of the barge canal for several weeks and several months, respectively.  Their cargo of dry ferrous sulfate was destined for Eaglebrook Inc. but was rejected because it was out of specification for their needs.  Ferrous sulfate is reacted in a controlled situation by Eaglebrook to make a flocculating agent used in wastewater treatment.  As the barges waited at the industrial park pending final disposition, it is believed that water entered the barges through holes in their wing tanks and then, through free communication with the hoppers themselves, made contact with the cargo.  During the response the contaminated water in the hoppers was found to have a pH of approximately 2.0.  The contaminated water in the wing tanks was found to have a pH of approximately 3.0.

Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.\u000b\u000bThe barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel. \u000b\u000bThe responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.\u000b\u000bThe USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea. \u000b\u000bOn January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.\u000b\u000bShoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.\u000b\u000bOn February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent. \u000b\u000bAll necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the \"how clean is clean\" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.

A wake from a passing bulk carrier apparently caused the parting of the Jupiter's  transfer hose, grounding cable, and all but one of its mooring lines.  Residual gasoline in the broken transfer hose was believed to have been ignited by a spark on the dock.  The Jupiter's  stern swung around into the Saginaw River and grounded perpendicular to the direction of the river flow.  The grounding resulted in a crack in the vessel's hull from the manifold on the starboard side to 75 feet aft of the manifold on the port side.\u000bArea marinas were evacuated and vessel traffic was halted.  Bangor County Fire Department and USCG personnel arrived on-scene within 30 minutes of the incident.  The pier fire was extinguished in an attempt to save the last mooring line while the fire onboard the vessel remained out of control.  Williams Boots & Coots Company (WB&C) from Houston, Texas, was contracted to fight the fire due to the lack of locally available trained personnel and equipment.  At 1315 on September 17, WB&C personnel extinguished the blaze by applying foam.  Carbon black accumulations falling from the overhead re-ignited the fire at 2300.

Dimethoate is a sulfur-containing compound with a mercaptin-like odor.  Its high molecular weight and low vapor pressure makes it quite stable in solid form at ambient temperatures, and its odor is noticeable even in extremely low concentrations.  NOAA hypothesized that some vapor from the solid dimethoate may have leaked into the closed container during shipment, and that it was this vapor that was detected while the vessel was en route to San Francisco.  The concentration in the atmosphere within the container was probably never at a toxic level even though it would have been uncomfortable to breathe.  Once the container was opened and exposed to circulating air, the detectable odor would dissipate rapidly.    NOAA recommended that personnel involved in the inspection of the shipping container be suited in Level B protection as a conservative measure as dimethoate does not present a significant inhalation hazard when shipped in solid form.  The primary concern with this product was to avoid inhalation or ingestion of airborne dust from a potentially damaged shipping container and to restrict dermal contact to minimize any chance of skin absorption.  A visual inspection of the container by the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office found no evidence of damage to the container or spillage of dimethoate.  Accordingly, the container was left aboard the vessel for continuation to the WAARDRECHT's destination in Mexico.   The case was closed after the container was inspected and found to be undamaged.

NOAA advised that potential health and\/or environmental impacts should be reported to local and state health officials and to state environmental officials.  Mr. Winkler reported that he had made a number of these reports to State and County officials but was not satisfied with their response.  After the first call, NOAA looked at the thermal images of the Gulf Stream and discussed with Mr. Winkler that Gulf Steam waters or material dumped in New York City would not be in direct contact with Bethany Bay beaches.  NOAA also contacted marine laboratories and phytoplankton experts at the University of Delaware, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Laboratories at Mountlake, WA, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  The names and contact numbers for phytoplankton experts at these institutions were provided to Mr. Winkler.   NOAA coordinated with the State of Delaware's environmental officials on each of the \"red tide\" reports that we received and with our efforts in contacting expert laboratories to determine the results of Mr. Winkler's samples.  On September 15th the Delaware's Director of Water Resources wrote a 4-page letter to Mr. Winkler listing the considerable efforts of the State of Delaware's Department of Water Resources to investigate each of Mr. Winkler's reports.  Delaware's letter noted that samples analyzed by DNREC \"reveal no Pfieseria, no significant water chemistry findings, and no presence of organisms in bloom-like conditions\" and that the \"water samples collected by you (Mr. Winkler) and DNREC that have been analyzed by the Florida Marine Research Institute and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute have revealed no harmful species, no toxic dinoflagellate species, and no red tide cell concentrations.\" On September 22ed the NOAA SSC discussed Mr. Winkler's reports with the Chief of the Bethany Beach Fire Company and a member of the Bethany Beach Town Council.  Both the Fire Chief and the member of the Town Council reported that there were no unusual health impact reports from swimmers using the city's beaches.

It seems clear to these scientists that much of the \"reds stuff in the water\" sightings reported during the summer of 2000 were algal booms.  The scientists reported that it is not unusual for these blooms to drift with the currents and appear or disappear from one day to the next (or even hour to hour.)  The \"disappearing\" of the bloom is likely due to wind and other weather conditions.  For example, when it is windy, the bloom, that is often concentrated near the surface, can be mixed down several feet and thus become almost invisible.  If the wind subsides and the sun conditions are right, these organisms can float or swim back to the surface and again become much more visible.

Apparently, a blowout preventer (BOP) valve malfunction caused the initial blowout.  Although the BOP had successfully shut the annulus between the drill pipe and well casing, the blind rams failed to shear through the drill pipe that was still in the well casing.  Therefore, oil and gas flowed out of the well, up the drill pipe, and onto the platform where it ignited.  The oil discharge increased after the escaping gas and oil forced the drill pipe out of the well.  The initial fire was extinguished by October 17.  As of October 28, the well was still spewing out a yellow gas\/crude mix  60-100 feet in the air.

A shut off valve to the old tank bottom was in an open position which allowed the fuel to pour out onto the ground. The tank is located approximately 1\/4  mile from the bay. The fuel filled a depression in the ground and then overflowed into an area which contained a drainage pipe.  The fuel flowed down this  drainage pipe directly into the bay.

Tomorrow winds will again be light, 5-15kts, with a generally southerly direction. Oil landfall is difficult to predict and is very dependent on what the wind does tomorrow. The oil in Dyes and Sinclair Inlet will tend to mill around with no dominate direction. Oil near rich Passage will be drawn into the Sound on the ebb tide. the next ebb will peak at about 1800. Oil in Port Orchard will tend to move north if the winds are as predicted.

It is not possible to pridict how oil leaving Rich Passage on an ebb will move  in the Sound. Clam Bay is at some risk.

Funds for the spill cleanup initially came from the USCG revolving oil pollution fund.  An overflight of the area was conducted at 1400.   \u000bThe spill occurred during a time when thousands of migratory birds are overwintering in the area.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 of these birds were oiled as a result of the spill.  Many birds were treated at the South Whidbey Island Wildlife Clinic.  On December 23, personnel at a bird clinic established at Mukilteo's Olympic Junior High school began cleaning and feeding hundreds of oiled birds.  The birds were washed with dish washing detergent and tube-fed a mixture of Kaopectate, honey, high-protein baby cereal, activated charcoal, thirst-quencher, and poison antidote until the center received a high-protein feed donated by Ralston Purina's Woodinville, Washington plant.

The vessel was loaded with 91,984 barrels of lube oil and lube oil additives and 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel. Two crewmen and the pilot from the vessel were thrown into the water by the blast. The pilot and one crewman were recovered with serious burns.  One crewman remained missing and was presumed dead after an extensive search.  The explosion caused a relatively minor release of oil.  Flames from the initial and subsequent explosions shot as high as 1000 feet into the sky.  The fires on board the vessel were extinguished by late afternoon on November 1.\u000bFollowing the explosion, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) ordered the vessel towed out of the vicinity of San Francisco Bay.  The intent of the order was to minimize the potential for catastrophic environmental effect from a massive release of oil.  On the basis of trajectory forecasts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommended that the vessel be towed to the vicinity of a nearby ocean dumping site (37 32 N, 122 59 W).  This position is at the continental shelf break, 10 miles SE of the Farallon Islands.  The ongoing firefighting and cooling efforts were hampered as the vessel moved farther from shore. \u000bThe weather worsened on November 2, with seas as high as 16 feet and wind speeds up to 35 knots.  Salvage and inspection activities ceased for the day.  On November 3 at 0000, the Puerto Rican broke in two, releasing 25,000-35,000 barrels of its cargo and an undetermined amount of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel onboard.  The stern section sank one mile inside the boundary of the Point Reyes\/Farallon Islands National Marine Sanctuary, taking most of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel with it.\u000bKeystone Shipping Co. of Philadelphia immediately assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.  They maintained responsibility throughout the response.\u000bFrom November 3-18, personnel from the USCG, NOAA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State of California, and numerous contractors and volunteers were involved with the response.

Weather at the time was cloudy and overcast with light rain.  Visibility was 8 miles with winds gusting from the northwest to 25 miles per hour.  Crew error was the primary cause of the accident.  The barges, V882, V883, V884, and V885, were laden with a total of approximately 65,003 barrels of Montana Mix sour crude oil.  One of the barges exploded on impact and burst into flames.  As the fire continued to spread, the tow broke, setting three of the burning barges adrift down the river.  The tug and attached barge V885 were moved to the Peabody Coal facility at mile 179.2 for lightering and inspection.\u000bThe three drifting barges caused extensive damage to facilities and other barges along the left descending bank on the Illinois side of the river.  While traveling downriver, one of the barges struck the Pillsbury Grain dock facility.  The fire spread to the dock, the grain elevator, and trees and bushes on the shoreline.  Three grain barges nearby caught fire as well.  A coal barge on the Missouri side of the river ignited from contact with one of the barges.  The Monsanto dock caught fire after being struck by one of the barges, and the impact ruptured a pipeline on a walkway, releasing approximately 100 pounds of monochlorobenzene into the river.\u000bBarge V884 suffered the most damage, both the barge and its discharged cargo on the river's surface were in flames.  After drifting downstream, V884 sank at mile 178.2 Upper Mississippi River (UMR) near the Cahokia Power Plant.  The barge continued to release its total cargo of 10,882 barrels of crude oil.  While burning out of control, barge V883 lodged bow first into the bank above the Cahokia Power Plant.  The fire spread uncontrollably onto the shore.  An hour later, V883 broke loose and continued drifting down the river, still engulfed in flames.  The M\/V Katie  eventually grounded V883 by pushing it into the bank at the Pillsbury Facility.  The leading barge, V882, was forced into the Arsenal Island barge fleet area after being controlled by the M\/V Gary D. Partridge.  \u000bThe USCG Cutters Obion  and Cheyenne  fought the fire on V883 as well as the fire at the Phillips facility.  The cutters used all but two of their fire fighting foam cans.  To reduce the probability of reflash, the Cheyenne  applied a low-velocity water fog to V883.  The M\/V Tom McConnel  used her propwash to keep burning oil on the water from reaching the Cheyenne  during firefighting operations.  By 1330 on April 3, the fires on the three escaped barges, the three grain barges, and the Pillsbury dock were out.  \u000bValley Towing Service, Inc., the owners of the tug and barges, assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.
